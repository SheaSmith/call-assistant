# Call Assistant

Call Assistant is a helper that will activate Google Assistant when a particular phone
number (`25555158`) is called.

The intended use of this is for older cars that have basic voice assistants (for example, older
Mazda's) that allow you to "Call \[name\]". This app allows you to program "Google Assistant" as a
contact, so that you can simply say "Call Google Assistant", which will dial the number. The app
will then intercept the call, wait 2 seconds, hang up, wait another few seconds and then launch
Google Assistant.
